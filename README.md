# Scripture Study by Derek R. Neilson

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to document my study of the scriptures (The Bible, The Book of Mormon, The Doctrine and Covenants, and The Pearl of Great Price). This project is a personal project and is not intended to be a scholarly work. The purpose of this project is to help me better understand the scriptures and is made public in the hope that it may be persevered primarily for my family and posterity. If it is of use to others that is permissible as well.

## Method of Study

I am starting at a near tabula rasa state. I have read the scriptures before, but I have not studied them in depth and know very little about them in terms of their historical context.

### Tools 

I am a computer scientist by trade and I know that not everyone is though, so I have tried to keep the files as human-readable without the need for special tools. Obsidian is the intended tool for viewing the files, but they are just markdown files and can be viewed in any text editor. I have also included PDFs that can be viewed in any PDF viewer. 

### Structure

The structure of the project is as follows:

- Atomic: These are the smallest units of study. They are the smallest units of thought that I can break the scriptures down into. They are intended to be small enough that I can study them in a single sitting.
- Books: These are the books of the scriptures. They are broken down into chapters and verses.
- New-Testament, Old-Testament, Book-of-Mormon, Doctrine-and-Covenants, Pearl-of-Great-Price: These are the books of the scriptures. They are broken down into chapters and verses.
