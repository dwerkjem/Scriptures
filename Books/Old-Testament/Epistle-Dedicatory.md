The Epistle Dedicatory starts with the following text:

> To the most high and mighty Prince **James**
> by the grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c.
> The Translators of the Bible wish Grace, Mercy, and Peace, through Jesus Christ our Lord

> No Bishop, No King (1659) by **James** I of England

> most dread sovereign, which Almighty God, the Father of all mercies, bestowed upon us the people of England 



Supposedly god bestowed the [[Royalty]] upon the people of England. This is a very interesting statement.
